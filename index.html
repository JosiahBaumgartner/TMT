        <h3 class="about-section-subheading">About our company</h3>
        <p class="about-content">We understand the hectic lifestyle that a high school student and their parents face. When is Jennifer, a sophomore at Jesuit, going to improve her understanding of physics while balancing 2 other AP courses, volleyball and orchestra? How would Samantha, a mother of 3, have the time or resources to take her son to SAT tutoring? Jennifer’s parents may be able to take her to an expensive tutoring institution, but does she really have the time to sit in traffic? Samantha must care deeply for her kids, but is it wise to trust a random college student with her child’s education just because they had an “A” in the class?<br>‍<br>TMT offers Portland quality tutoring at a location convenient to our students at an accessible price. Our team of accredited and certified tutors are teachers with years of experience. Despite their experience, all of them go through rigorous training to ensure the standards we require our tutors to have. The level of tutoring we provide is comparable only with well known tutoring companies in the area, which are typically in the price range of $100-$150 per hour here in Portland. Additionally, these companies only teach at set locations, which not only are a hassle to get to, but adds to the price. We will deliver Portland Quality tutoring at a convenient time for students and parents at a lower price. To provide the Portland Quality to all students, we’re also reaching out and offering financial assistance to serious students in need, namely those who receive help with food from the school district. <br></p>

        <h3 class="about-section-subheading">About our team</h3>
        <p class="about-content">TMT truly cares for our students. We focus on in-home and online tutoring because we see the struggles of our overachievers trying to balance 3 AP courses. We know our price point is fair because we’re not one of those companies that just has a random assortment of college students or a highly exclusive and expensive company just trying to make more money. We truly want to give every student a chance even if it’s not their favorite subject or their financial situations may not permit them. We are the team that provides the Portland Quality.</p>
