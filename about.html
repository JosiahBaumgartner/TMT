      <p id="w-node-b806f91f91e8-b7b38bf1" class="company-story-content">When Take Morikawa moved up to Portland from sunny San Diego in February of 2018, he was already a seasoned tutor. Having experience in everything from tutoring students in SAT subject math tests to teaching dyslexic students calculus, both in classes and one-on-one, there was no doubt in his mind that there would be a need for his services. That’s why he started TMT teaching... but just like everyone else, he had to make a living and establish himself in the area. So he also worked for other tutoring institutions and connected with local tutors. <br>‍<br>Unintentionally, this is how he came to realize the issue in the Portland area. <strong>Portland tutors are either very good and extremely expensive or cheap and very bad, there’s rarely an exception.</strong> <br><br>Several times while talking to very qualified tutors in the area, Take asked why they were charging the rate they were. The answer? “Because we can” or “because they keep coming”.<br><br>Our rate is not cheap, but it is fair. Further, if there’s a student with serious dreams and ambitions, but they simply don’t have the resources, we will be there for them. Everyone deserves a chance. Everyone deserves to have Portland Quality Tutoring. <br></p><img src="images/Optimized-TMT-About-Story.jpg" width="756" srcset="images/Optimized-TMT-About-Story-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/Optimized-TMT-About-Story.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 84vw, (max-width: 991px) 78vw, 33vw" id="w-node-95419bb11adc-b7b38bf1" alt="" class="image-4"></div>
